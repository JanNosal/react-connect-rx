# react-connect-rx

<h1>WIP</h1>
<h2>not stable</h2>
At this stage, I do not recommend to use this. First - it is so small, that you might be better to
implement your own (similar or maybe better) solution. Then - it is not very well tested and the api may
be changing quickly.
The reason I have published this code is that I will use this little library for couple of my projects and I intend to work on it,
while working on the projects.
